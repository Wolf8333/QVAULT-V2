# 🧠 QVAULT Smart Contract Update Proposal – May 2025

## 📄 Summary

This proposal seeks to update the QVAULT smart contract to enable **true decentralization** of the Qubic Capital project. The update will transfer key system controls—such as fundraising, marketplace actions, and revenue distribution—to the collective governance of $QCAP holders.

Once this proposal is accepted and implemented, all future decisions will be handled through decentralized proposals, empowering the community and ensuring transparent, trustless execution.
